## 💡 The Idea
<p>

While I was a student at VIT 🎓, I noticed how hard it was to access timetables via the official VIT app. It was often down or hard to use 😩, so most students just saved messy screenshots of their timetables. 

</p>
<p>

When I joined **GDSC-VIT**, I saw the potential in Vitty but realized the app had major backend limitations – Firebase (on a free tier) couldn’t handle the growing number of users. I decided to take on the challenge, rewrote the backend in **Golang**, and made it scalable with **PostgreSQL**.

</p>
<p>

I also introduced a **social feature** where students can **connect with friends** and check their timetables to see when they’re free for study sessions or hangouts. This revamp has made Vitty more efficient, reliable, and able to serve its **40,000+ active users** 📈.

</p>

## 🚀 Conclusion

Vitty is no longer just a timetable app 📅 – it’s now a social tool for **VIT students** to stay connected, organized, and in sync. The app is built to scale, with a user-friendly design and seamless performance, ready for future growth! 🌟
