# Tizori

**Tizori** is a self-hosted credentials manager designed to simplify the secure sharing of credentials within teams! 🔐 It provides role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can manage and share credentials effectively and securely. As the lead of a large community of developers, managers, and designers, I recognized the challenge of sharing credentials securely across various tools. Tizori is built to solve this problem, offering a free alternative to services like 1Password.

## 💡 The Idea
<p>

As the lead of a large community of developers, managers, and designers, I recognized the challenge of securely sharing access to different tools and credentials. It often became cumbersome to manage these credentials without compromising security.

</p>
<p>

I envisioned a solution akin to a free 1Password that would enable role-based permissions for reading or writing credentials, allowing me to assign roles to users effectively. This inspired the creation of **Tizori**, which provides a secure and manageable way to handle credentials within a team.

</p>

## 🚀 Conclusion

Tizori is not just a credentials manager; it's a vital tool for teams to collaborate securely and efficiently. Built with scalability in mind, it ensures that managing credentials is straightforward and safe, ready for future growth! 🌟
