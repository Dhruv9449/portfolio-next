## 💡 The Idea
<p>

After learning the basics of **Golang**, I wanted to build something substantial to solidify my understanding of the language and its ecosystem. At the same time, I was curious about **React** and **TypeScript** – technologies I had heard about but never used in a real project.

</p>
<p>

I decided to combine both learning goals into one project: a personal blogging platform that would also serve as my portfolio website. This gave me a clear purpose and real-world constraints – the platform had to be functional, user-friendly, and production-ready since I intended to actually use it.

</p>
<p>

The **Google APIs** integration was particularly interesting. Instead of building complex file storage from scratch, I leveraged the **Google Drive API** to handle static content backups. Similarly, **Google Identity Services** provided a robust, enterprise-grade authentication solution that users already trust.

</p>
<p>

This project wasn't just about building features – it was about understanding the entire full-stack development process, from API design and database modeling to frontend state management and cloud deployment. Every challenge taught me something valuable about building scalable, maintainable web applications.

</p>

## 🚀 Conclusion

Mou represents a significant milestone in my development journey! 🌟 It brought together backend expertise in Go, frontend skills in React and TypeScript, cloud services integration, and DevOps practices. More than just code, it's a complete learning experience that prepared me for building complex, production-ready applications. The platform successfully serves as both a functional blogging system and a testament to continuous learning and experimentation with new technologies.
