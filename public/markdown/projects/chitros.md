# Chitros

**Chitros** is a social media backend API that mimics Instagram's core functionalities! 📸 Built to explore modern web API development, it implements features like posting pictures, following friends, viewing feeds, searching users, liking, and commenting. This project was my first deep dive into building a REST API with **FastAPI**, containerization with **Docker**, and modern ORM tools.

## 💼 My Contributions

- 👨‍💻 Developed the **entire backend API** from scratch using **FastAPI**, implementing all core social media features.
- 🗄️ Set up **PostgreSQL** with **SQLAlchemy ORM** for efficient data management and complex relationships.
- 🔄 Implemented **Alembic** for database migrations, ensuring smooth schema evolution.
- 🐳 Containerized the application using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for consistent development and deployment environments.
- ☁️ Deployed the application on **Heroku** and **Railway**, gaining experience with both PaaS and IaaS platforms.
- 🔐 Built authentication and authorization systems to secure user data and endpoints.

## 💡 The Idea
<p>

When I was first learning backend development, I wanted to understand how REST APIs work by building something familiar. Instagram's features provided the perfect blueprint – complex enough to be challenging but well-defined enough to have clear goals.

</p>
<p>

I chose **FastAPI** because of its modern Python approach, automatic API documentation, and excellent performance. This project was also my introduction to **SQLAlchemy**, **Alembic migrations**, and **Docker containerization** – all essential tools for modern backend development.

</p>
<p>

The goal wasn't just to build another social media clone, but to deeply understand REST API design patterns, database relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), authentication flows, and deployment processes. Each feature taught me something new about building scalable, maintainable backend systems.

</p>

## 🚀 Conclusion

Chitros was a fantastic learning experience that gave me a solid foundation in backend development! 🌟 From understanding ORM relationships to containerization and cloud deployment, this project helped me develop the skills needed to build production-ready APIs. It's not just about the code – it's about understanding the entire development lifecycle from local development to production deployment.
